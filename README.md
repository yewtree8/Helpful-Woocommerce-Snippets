# The Woocommerce Random Code Snippets

I spent a lot of time figuring out the API at my new job and I barely did a lot of php when I was growing up (which by the way has the most horrific syntax out of all the higher level languages, don't @ me), so hopefully these little code snippets shall help you, they're on my gists but this is more publically 
accessible here.

## What you'll find

Who knows? Maybe a solution to your current problem you're facing for your wordpress woocommerce store, it's just here, by the time you find it it may not work and I'm sorry, if so, open an issue :)

## How to use?

Inside the snippets folder there are a set of files that should be well documented explaining how to do certain things within the Woocoommerce api,
 my hope is that there is a kid out there trying to make his own E-Commerce store and is trying to get his way around the horrible base wordpress creates, 
 maybe this helps you, maybe this doesn't, either way. Maybe throw a star or even a fork my way if you like what I'm doing!
 
 *note that all snippets are just bits of code you put in your themes functions.php file and are simply cool things, DO NOT take this as proper practice to building a large scale E-Commerce site and please
 learn from my comments, this is not to spoon feed you code! (Unless you're not actually aspiring to be a developer)*

## Current Snippets

- **DisvowCouponsForItems**<br>
This is a script I came up with on the fly as our company had a Black Friday sale, there were massive discounts already on the packages we were offering but people
were still using coupon codes on top, which made it **even cheaper** for the user which was not good for business.
 <br><br>
 I was asked to make it so that certain products would be exempt from coupon discounts in the basket (as we could lose money and it could come in handy in the future). So I made a script that
 would simply add a checkbox on the "general" product setting on the back end to make them exempt when it came to processing them and calculating coupon values, 
 this was written in woocommerce 3.0 API.

 ** To be continued....** <br>

 



## How well will this be maintained?

Welp, like all open source projects we'll just have to find out! I've only recently moved into the ambiguous world of web development and why not help others? :)
