# The Woocommerce Random Code Snippets

I spent a lot of time figuring out the API at my new job and I barely did a lot of php when I was growing up (which by the way has the most horrific syntax out of all the higher level languages, don't @ me), so hopefully these little code snippets shall help you, they're on my gists but this is more publically 
accessible here.

## What you'll find

Who knows? Maybe a solution to your current problem you're facing for your wordpress woocommerce store, it's just here, by the time you find it it may not work and I'm sorry, if so, open an issue :)

## How to use?

Inside the snippets folder there are a set of files that should be well documented explaining how to do certain things within the woocoommerce api,
 my hope is that there is a kid out there trying to make his own E-Commerce store and is trying to get his way around the horrible base wordpress creates, 
 maybe this helps you, maybe this doesn't, either way. Maybe throw a star or even a fork my way if you like what I'm doing!
 
 *note that all snippets are just bits of code you put in your themes functions.php file and are simply cool things, DO NOT take this as proper practice to building a large scale E-Commerce site*

## How well will this be maintained?

Welp, we'll just have to find out!
